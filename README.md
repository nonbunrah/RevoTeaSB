# RevoTea

RevoTea is an application created to help improve customer service and improve efficiency: 

## How it works
 1. Login to the application. If you don't have an account, you can always hit the sign up button and fill out the information. If you don't want to do either of those, you can always checkout as guest.
 2. After logging in to the site, you go to the Boba ordering page and add drinks to your cart or remove them. If you'd like to add a drink with toppings, click add, and then click toppings. 
 3. If you go to the toppings page, you can select multiple toppings (free of cost) and select how much ice and sweetness you would like. 
 4. After hitting checkout, you'll be taken to a cart screen where you can click the "update total" button to see the number of items in your cart and the total amount owed. 
 5. When you hit checkout, you will be led to the checkout page where you fill in your card information. On submission, your payment will be processed.
